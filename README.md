# ML_course_project_CIFAR-10-classifier
In this course project of the Machine Learning-I, the goal is to classify natural images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. In part-1, we have developed a SVM based classifier with 10 classes. Next, we have replaced the SVM with CNN based multi-class classifier to improve accuracy.
